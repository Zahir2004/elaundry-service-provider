virtual environment name : e_laundry_project

4th sem project :- note for django:
# first make a virtual environment name :e_laundry_project
# start a project in virtual environment name :project_4th_sem
# make a app for project where all project work can be done name:e_laundry
# in app e_laundry add a urls.py file  
# in urls.py import path from django.urls for define a path of every url we use in the 
  project urls to our main project
# we define urlpatterns for list the url we use
# we use views by from . import views for done somthing like http responce,json or 
  difine functions etc.
# we define function in views.py which can excess by views.function_name in urls.py
# in views.py for getting httpresponce we import Httpresponce from django.http
# for getting the url in the main project :project_4th_sem we have to specifies include
  in urls.py from project_4th_sem and include the urls.py from e_laundry 
# we make a template folder for store all template file like html fils use in project
# we have to define the template folder in settings.py in  project_4th_sem for know the 
  project where to search the template file and get the file from it
# we search TEMPLATES in settings.py and in DIRS we define the template folder for know
  the project where to look for the template files
# we can directly define the html file by render it in function inside the views.py
# we use context as a dictionary for defing the keys and values for the html page if
  any variable we want to change from project and we can show the value through the key
  by defining {{key_of_the_value}} in html file
# here we take the data from user by taking a variable and get the data by request from
  the name define in the line inside the html file :request.GET/POST['name_in_html']
# when we use GET method the input from the user can display with the link of the web 
# so for privacy/personal purpose we use POST method so the inputs not display anymore 
  but for using POST method we have to access it from CSRF token and we do it by define
  {% csrf_token %} in html file
# for all the static file like css file,js file etc, we make a static folder
# for defining the static folder for the project we have to first import os below 
  import path in settings.py and after that, below STATIC_URL we define static file
# for working of css file we have to use the static tag in the link of css file and
  load the static tag in the html file 
  ex:-{% load static %}
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css_file' %}">
# in models.py we can define a class,declare its elements and its datatype and one of 
  the element is id ,then give value for the class element in views.py and render it by
  dictionary and give the key in html file 
  ex-:{{key_name.class_element}}
# for loop in django in html file:- 
  {% for __ in __ %}
  --------
  --------
  {% endfor %}
# for condition in django in html file:- {% if -<condition>- %}
  ------
  {% elif -<conditoin>- %}
  ------ 
  {% else %}
  ------
  {% endif %}
# by define a class with models.Model it become a model and it dont requre an id to 
  define :-class Class_Name(models.Model) 
# we can use different fields in the place of datatype
# for integrate database we have to register the e_laundry in project_4th_sem through 
  settings.py by adding e_laundry in INSTALLED_APPS 
# now we migrate the data into the database through command prompt by 2 step command
# by add /admin in our link it open a admin panel log in page and give the username 
  password from command prompt we enter the admin panel
  user_name = e-laundry
  password = 21ug010cse
# for reflecting the model in admin panel we have to register it in admin.py by
  :- admin.site.register(Model_Class_Name)
# for get the class from models we have to import it to views.py and then render it and
  for get all the data we use :- Class_name.objects.all()
# now we make the register page so we add a register path in urls.py
# define the register function in views.py
# in register function for redirect the user to another page after signup we have to 
  first import redirect and for saving the user in database we have to import User, auth
  where User is the databse where all user can store and auth is a method which allow us
  to authenticate and we also import messages from django.contrib
# for knowing someone is authenticated inside the database and visit the homepage we 
  can show some differnt stuff like his name by us user.is_authenticated for varified 
# for change the database from sqlite to postgresql we change the DATABASE in the 
  setting.py and change the ENGIN,NAME and add USER,PASSWORD,HOST in it
# now for our own uses we need to create a custom user for saving the data we want for
  the user
# so we first import AbstractBaseUser and BaseUserManager from django.contrib.auth.models 
# make our own User name as Holder by create class Holder and class MyHolderManage
# after finish the class we should define :-
              AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'app_name,Custom_user_class_name'
  here we define AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'e_laundry,Holder'
# for fully usable we have to delete all privious migration and set a new migration to
  work of custom user
# for custom user we have to make a superuser by:-
              python manage.py createsuperuser
  Username: admin
  Email: tonyaklesh4286@gmail.com
  Password: 4286
  Phone: 4286
  role: 2
# for redirect a html page we have first creat method and use it in the anchor tag of 
  html page and in views.py we have to make a function of it
# we can only get the data from html page by input type and we do that by pass the name
  of the input type in a method of views.py by 
                variable = request.POST['name']
# When we retrive data from the postgresql table we have to show the structure of our 
  code to understand how the data is getting , we write model_name.attributes.all()
  [id].column_name
      example:-
              item.objects.all()[0].item_name
#
